  <p>
  When it starts a new job, Jenkins SGE Plugin tries to use an existing idle
  agent.  If there are no idle agents, a new agent is automatically
  provisioned.</p>
  <p>
  When things are less busy, idle agents are terminated after being idle for the
  <em>Maximum idle time</em> specified here.</p>
  <p>
  Each project has a <em>Workspace</em> button that you can use to view the
  project workspace files in your web browser.  This handy feature relies on the
  agent that executed the job.  If the agent is gone, the workspace can no
  longer be viewed via the Jenkins web interface.  If this happens often,
  consider increasing the <em>Maximum idle time</em>.</p>
  <p>
  Note that the <em>Maximum idle time</em> applies only to newly provisioned
  agents.  Existing agents retain the maximum idle time that was in effect when
  they were provisioned.</p>
  <p>
  Handy conversions:
  <ul>
  <li>1440 minutes = 1 day</li>
  <li>2880 minutes = 2 days</li>
  <li>4320 minutes = 3 days</li>
  <li>5760 minutes = 4 days</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
